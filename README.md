What's in this repo:

# bin
	java binary files

# src
	There are four java source files in this directory:
	(1) AddressBook.java:	This is the class that stores info and defines functions related to managing a list of contacts
	(2) Contacts.java:	This class stores info and defines functions related to a single contact and it's associated entry fields
	(3) EntryField.java	This class stores info related to a particular entry field. *Made this class for the sake of allowing users to create custom entry fields
	(4) aFrame.java		This is my shitty GUI for testing the backend

# aBook.ser
	this is serialized java object file. It's the default address book file for saving a book of contacts
